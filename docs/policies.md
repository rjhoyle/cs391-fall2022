# Course Policy


## Grading

Grading is going to be based on attendance and on a final writeup, which will be determined by the size of the class.  


## Attendance
As this is a seminar class, regular class attendance and participation are required.  There will be a maximum of 2 unexcused absences, and afterwards, they will impact your course grade.  There will be a sign-in poll at the start of class every day.
	
If a student arrives late, they may not get attendance credit for that day.  Please arrive on time and ready to participate by the scheduled start time.


## Weekly Readings and Reports
There will be weekly reading assignments, and all students are expected to participate in the discussions of those papers.

	
## Paper Presentations
Each student will be expected to present a paper in full, and we will rotate each week who is doing the presentations.


## Accommodations for students with disabilities

If you have a disability that might impact your performance in this course, or requires special accommodation, please contact me as soon as possible so that appropriate arrangements can be made.
You will need to contact the 
[Office of Disability Access](https://www.oberlin.edu/disability-access) to get your disability documented before
accommodations can be made.

There is also support available through the Quantitative Skills Center, 
<a href="http://new.oberlin.edu/office/clear/for-students/drop-in-tutoring/">CLEAR</a>.
They have drop-in hours where you can ask for assistance on programming assignments from
other students who have experience.

The Computer Science Department is committed to access in its broadest
sense of the word. If you identify as a low-income student, and you are
experiencing challenges with securing funds to purchase required materials
for this course (books/clickers/a working laptop) you can apply for funding
support through
[ObieCares](https://www.oberlin.edu/dean-of-students/initiatives/obiecares)


If you are a student who is not diagnosed with a disability but suspect you
may have one, please reach out to
(Accessibility Services)[https://www.oberlin.edu/accessibility-services] and choose the red button
about half way down the page to schedule a 15 minute informational meeting
with OSAS.


## Plagiarism and Academic Dishonesty
I have very low tolerance for academic dishonesty, and will vigorously
pursue available remedies for any incidents.   All work in this class is to
be performed according to the <a href="http://new.oberlin.edu/students/policies/11-Policies-Honor.pdf">Oberlin
Honor Code</a>. Specifically I expect that:
<ol class="padded">
		<li>Reports will be written individually by the student, and only after reading of the material in question.  Discussion of readings is expected and encouraged, however.</li>

		<li>Sources should be cited including the textbook and other web sites
				when you use them in your work.</li>

		<li>You are not permitted to share your source code with other
				students, including future ones.</li>
</ol>

All assignments must include the following signed statement:

<blockquote class="honor">
		"I have adhered to the Honor Code in this assignment."
</blockquote>
Electronic submissions should include the honor statement in either the
README file or header comments and must include your name.

Please note that claiming credit for others' work is a violation of the honor principle.  This means that if you do not participate in your project, and let your partners do all the work, not only will you fail, you will also be reported for infringing on the honor code.
